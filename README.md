This repository contains all the files necessary for a online Jigsaw Puzzle game. The website can be found at: 

https://birkbeck2.github.io/web-project-adeledsg/index.html 

This online game was made in the context of a homework assignment and is not for commercial use. It is submitted along a report via Turnitin. 

# File content 
The following HTML and Javascript files are used to create the game:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Landing page |
| `puzzle1.html` | Game 1 - 2x2 Puzzle |
| `puzzle2.html` | Game 2 - 3x3 Puzzle |
| `puzzle3.html` | Game 3 - 4x4 Puzzle |
| `interactive1.js` | Javascript for Puzzle 1 |
| `interactive2.js` | Javascript for Puzzle 2 |
| `interactive13.js` | Javascript for Puzzle 3 |

Additionally, a global stylesheet entitled `style.css` is used to set styles for all four HTML pages above.

Detailed comments providing explanation on implementation details, the files' structure, and references are mainly included in interactive1.js and style.CSS. As interactive2.js and intercative3.js follow the exact same logic, no further comments have been provided. 

All images (individual puzzle pieces) can be found in either the `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, or `puzzle3` folder.
